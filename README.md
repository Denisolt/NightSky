# Night Sky

A way to avoid paying 50 bucks by using some js to generate an image of the night sky at specific time at a specific location. 

I hope someone finds this useful.

## Problem

There are websites like thenightsky.com that offer posters with the view of the night sky. Example is below: 

There is only one problem and that is the cost. a poster like this will end up being around 40-50 bucks.

## Solution

Some open source work, a little bit of js and call it a day. Made my own version. Bless up, not paying 50 bucks for a poster. 



## Deployment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Denisolt/NightSky
cd NightSky
open the index file
```

too easy to even explain, fam.
